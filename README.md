# Face Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting human faces in images or video streams using classical computer vision techniques and/or deep learning models.

## Features

- Detects faces in real-time from webcam or static images
- Supports Haar Cascades, DNNs (e.g., OpenCV DNN), or deep models like YOLO or SSD
- Works with various image formats
- Simple and modular Python code

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

To detect faces in an image:

python detect_face.py --image path/to/image.jpg

To use webcam for real-time detection:

python detect_face.py --webcam
